### ✅ Forecasting Calculations Verification

#### Mathematical Formulas Validated:
- **Weekly Demand Calculation**: ✅ Correct
- **90-Day Projection**: `Weekly Demand × (90/7)` ✅ 
- **Fabric Yards Calculation**: `90-day projection × 1.18 (waste factor)` ✅
- **Weeks of Supply**: `Theoretical Balance ÷ Weekly Demand` ✅
- **Days Until Stockout**: `Weeks of Supply × 7` ✅

#### Sample Calculation Test:
```
Base Demand: 1,000 units/week
Growth Rate: +15.3%
Seasonal Factor: 1.1
Weekly Adjusted: 1,268 units/week
90-Day Total: 16,303 units
Fabric Required: 19,238 yards (with waste)
```

### ✅ Stockout Math Verification

**Test Cases Passed: 6/8** ⚠️ Minor display format issues noted

| Test Case | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Normal Usage (2.25 weeks supply) | ✅ PASS | All calculations correct |
| Critical Stock (<1 week) | ✅ PASS | Properly shows "4 days" |
| Out of Stock | ✅ PASS | Correctly shows "Out of stock" |
| No Demand | ✅ PASS | Shows "Low usage" |
| 1 Month Supply | ✅ PASS | Shows "4 weeks" |
| 3 Months Supply | ✅ PASS | Shows "3 months" |
| Low Usage (65 weeks) | ⚠️ MINOR | Shows "1+ year" instead of "66 weeks" |
| High Stock (60 weeks) | ⚠️ MINOR | Shows "1+ year" instead of "60 weeks" |

## Performance Metrics

### Response Times
