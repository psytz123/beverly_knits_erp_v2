# Beverly Knits ERP System Overhaul - Project Handoff Document

## 🚨 CRITICAL INFORMATION - READ FIRST

### System Access (UPDATED)
- **Main Application**: `src/core/beverly_comprehensive_erp.py` (17,734 lines!)
- **Port**: **5006** (NOT 5005 or 5003)
- **Start Command**: `python src/core/beverly_comprehensive_erp.py`
- **Kill Command**: `pkill -f "python.*beverly"` (Windows: use Task Manager)
- **Project Root**: `D:\AI\Workspaces\efab.ai\beverly_knits_erp_v2`

### Current Critical Issues
1. **System crashes frequently** - memory leaks, data loading failures
2. **Performance degradation** - API timeouts, slow page loads
3. **Data inconsistencies** - Planning Balance calculations incorrect
4. **SharePoint sync broken** - requires manual intervention
5. **Monolithic architecture** - 7000+ line single file

### Business Constraints
- **MUST preserve ALL custom business calculations** (extensive throughout code)
- **System must remain operational during refactoring** (parallel run required)
- **Forecast accuracy is CRITICAL** - target 90%+ at 9-week horizon
- **Timeline**: 2 months to production
- **Users**: Currently 1 executive, adding purchasing/planning users soon

### DO NOT TOUCH
- **Dashboard UI/Styling** - Files are LOCKED from visual changes
- **Custom Business Logic** - Extract but NEVER modify calculations
- **API Endpoints** - Must maintain backward compatibility

## 🔧 TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Key Business Calculations to Preserve

```python
# 1. Planning Balance (CRITICAL - often wrong)
# CORRECT FORMULA:
planning_balance = theoretical_balance + allocated + on_order
# Note: Allocated is ALREADY NEGATIVE in data files

# 2. Weekly Demand Calculation
if consumed_data_exists:
    weekly_demand = abs(monthly_consumed) / 4.3
elif allocated_exists:
    weekly_demand = allocated_qty / 8  # 8-week production cycle
else:
    weekly_demand = 10  # minimal default

# 3. Yarn Substitution Score
similarity_score = (
    color_match_weight * 0.3 +
    composition_match_weight * 0.4 +
    weight_match_weight * 0.3
)
```

### Critical Data Mappings

```python
# Style Reference Mapping
# fStyle# (in inventory files) ↔ Style# (in production/BOM)

# Yarn ID Standardization
# All variations map to 'Desc#':
yarn_id_mappings = {
    'Yarn_ID': 'Desc#',
    'YarnID': 'Desc#',
    'Yarn ID': 'Desc#',
    'Desc': 'Desc#'
}

# Column Name Variations (handle typos)
column_mappings = {
    'Planning_Ballance': 'Planning_Balance',  # Common typo
    'Theoratical_Balance': 'Theoretical_Balance'
}
```

### Performance Targets

## 💡 FINAL NOTES

This is a critical production system for a textile manufacturing company. The complexity comes from:
- Extensive custom business logic throughout
- Poor initial architecture (evolved, not designed)
- Multiple failed refactoring attempts
- Real-time operational dependency

The key to success is:
1. **Incremental changes** - Don't break what works
2. **Extensive testing** - Validate every change
3. **Business logic preservation** - Extract but don't modify
4. **Performance focus** - Current issues are blocking operations
5. **Clear documentation** - Future maintainers will thank you

Good luck! This system is challenging but the business impact of stabilizing it is significant.
