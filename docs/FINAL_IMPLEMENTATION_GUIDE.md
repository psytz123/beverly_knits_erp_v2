# 🚀 Beverly Knits ERP v2 - Production Implementation Guide

## ✅ Project Status: Production Active with eFab/QuadS Integration

### Current System Architecture

The Beverly Knits ERP v2 is now running as a unified system with direct API integration to:

#### 1. **Live Platform Integrations**
- **eFab Platform**: Production orders, inventory, sales data
- **QuadS System**: Style management, greige and finished goods
- **Real-time APIs**: All data fetched automatically, no file uploads required

#### 2. **Core System Components**
- **Main ERP Engine**: `beverly_comprehensive_erp.py` (unified application)
- **API Integration Layer**: Direct connections to eFab and QuadS
- **ML Forecasting Engine**: Predictive analytics and demand forecasting
- **Web Dashboard**: Real-time data visualization and reporting

#### 3. **Active API Endpoints**
- Sales Order Management: `/api/sales-order/plan/list`, `/api/knitorder/list`
- Inventory Management: `/api/yarn/active`, `/api/greige/*`, `/api/finished/*`
- Style Integration: `/api/styles/*` (eFab and QuadS)
- Reporting: `/api/report/*` endpoints for yarn demand and analytics

## 📋 Current Production Deployment
