# Production Tab Update Guide

## Updates Made
The Production tab in the consolidated dashboard has been enhanced with:

### 1. Forecasted Production Orders (Net Requirements)
- Shows forecasted demand using net requirements calculation
- Formula: Net Requirement = Forecasted Demand - Current Inventory - Pipeline Inventory
- Displays priority and confidence levels for each order
- Includes a "Load Data" button for manual refresh

### 2. AI-Optimized Production Recommendations
- Shows optimization scores (On-Time, Inventory, Cost, Capacity)
- Displays high-priority alerts and optimization opportunities
- Includes "Regenerate" button for refreshing AI suggestions

## How to Access

1. **Main Dashboard**: http://localhost:5005/consolidated
2. **Test Page**: http://localhost:5005/test_production_functions.html

## Troubleshooting

### If data doesn't appear automatically:

1. **Open Browser Console** (F12)
2. **Navigate to** http://localhost:5005/consolidated
3. **Click on the Production tab**
4. **In the console, manually run**:
   ```javascript
   loadForecastedOrders()
   loadAIProductionSuggestions()
   ```

### Alternative: Use the Load Data Button
- Look for the purple "Load Data" button in the Forecasted Production Orders section
- Click it to manually load the data

### Check API Status
Visit http://localhost:5005/test_production_functions.html to verify:
- Production Planning API is working
- Inventory Intelligence API is returning data
- Net requirements are being calculated correctly

## API Endpoints Used

- `/api/production-planning` - Production schedule and capacity
- `/api/inventory-intelligence-enhanced` - Inventory and forecast data
- `/api/production-suggestions` - AI recommendations

## Data Flow

1. **Demand Consolidation**: Fetches 90-day forecast from inventory intelligence
2. **Inventory Assessment**: Gets current inventory across all stages
3. **Net Requirements**: Calculates production needs after netting inventory
4. **AI Optimization**: Generates recommendations based on multiple criteria

## Known Issues

- Functions may not auto-load on first page load
- Use the manual "Load Data" button or console commands as workaround
- Ensure server is running on port 5005

## Console Debug Commands

```javascript
// Check if functions exist
typeof loadForecastedOrders
typeof loadAIProductionSuggestions

// Manually load data
loadForecastedOrders()
loadAIProductionSuggestions()

// Check element existence
document.getElementById('totalDemand90Days')
document.getElementById('forecastedOrdersTable')
document.getElementById('aiProductionSuggestions')
```
