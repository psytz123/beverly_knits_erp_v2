  COMPREHENSIVE AI AGENT ARCHITECTURE FOR EFAB ERP PLATFORM

    Based on analysis of the current Beverly Knits ERP system and modern AI agent patterns, I'll design a
    production-ready, enterprise-grade AI agent architecture that transforms the ERP into an intelligent, self-managing
    manufacturing platform.

    CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS

    Beverly Knits ERP Foundation Assets

    Existing Intelligence Components:
    - AI Production Model with bottleneck detection and optimization
    - Service Manager with dependency injection for modular services
    - ML forecasting with Prophet, XGBoost, LSTM ensemble models
    - Intelligent inventory analysis with planning balance calculations
    - Production capacity management with machine-level optimization
    - Column standardization and data consistency management

    Gaps Identified:
    - No centralized AI agent orchestration system
    - Limited autonomous decision-making capabilities
    - Manual implementation processes requiring human oversight
    - Isolated AI components without coordination
    - No learning feedback loops between implementations
